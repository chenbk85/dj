            I'm also the MC who handles the announcements and helps orchestrate the evening.
            I'll work with your venue, caterer, and photographer to make sure that everything goes
            as smoothly as it should and pick up any slack or fix any last minute oopses.
            If an important family member is having car trouble or a last minute modification
            to the cake is in progress, I'll provide entertainment.

            The LDS Youth and Young Single Adult (YSA) activities are the events I love doing the most,
            especially the formal and semi-formal dances.
          p.
            As with all events, I'd love to help your ward and stake activities committee
            with catering, photography, and event planning.

          h2 Why use a DJ?
          div
            p.
              Occasionally you'll hear suggestions to use some old blown out speakers from someone's
              former-DJ uncle's basement or to play music through the overhead system in the cultural
              hall (that will ruin the overhead speakers, by the way - they're intended for hymns at
              low volume) and just play a playlist from YouTube.
            p.
              I advise against that for the following reasons:
            ul
              li This is a dance, sound quality is important
              li If you play loud top 40s music through the cultural hall overheads, you'll damage them
              li Finding out that your YouTube playlist doesn't have the clean radio edit is an unpleasant surprise
              li Having someone to "work the crowd" and modify the playlist on-the-fly makes the dance more enjoyable
              li All of the music, especially requests, should be previewed before being played
